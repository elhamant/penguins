```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

Now, I want to understand the relationship between body mass and flipper length. 

<br>

Below, I plotted the relationship between body mass and flipper length. It shows that as body mass increases, flipper length also increases. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm))+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  geom_point(aes(color=species))+
  labs(title="Relationship Between Flipper Length and Body Mass of Penguins", x=" Body Mass", y="Flipper Length")+
  theme_bw()
```
