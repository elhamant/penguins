These data are from *palmerspenguins* dataset. Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

This package contains two datasets, with 344 penguins. One is called *penguins* and is a simplified version of the second dataset, which is called *penguins_raw*. *penguins_raw* contains all the original data and variables.
